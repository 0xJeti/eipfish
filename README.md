# EIP Fishing

This is an AWS Lambda that runs a small Go binary on a schedule. 
Each execution of the binary will allocate an Elastic IP (EIP) in the region you specify. 
It will then check for dangling name server records using a separately hosted [RDNS library stored on S3](https://github.com/timkoopmans/rdns-fs). 
It also checks for historical records using the [Shodan API](https://developer.shodan.io/api).

If there are any matches, it retains the EIP for further use, otherwise it releases the allocation back to the pool.

## Setup

Make sure you provide your own `.env` file with following keys:    

    WEBHOOK_URL="<your own incoming webhook URL for Slack>"
    BUCKET_NAME="<name of bucket with rDNS data>"
    BUCKET_REGION="<region of bucket with rDNS data>"
    SHODAN_API_KEY="<paid subscription to Shodan>"

Install serverless:

    npm install serverless -g

Deploy using your own AWS environment:

    make deploy

## Cost

The cost is approx. $0.007 per execution if youâ€™re interested in this lottery approach to EIP fishing:

    $0.005 per EIP + (5300 ms * $0.0000000021) lambda time + (1 GB * $0.00225) s3 select

## tl;dr

This is a simple lambda that I am using to help discover dangling NS records related to AWS EIPs for bug bounty programs.
